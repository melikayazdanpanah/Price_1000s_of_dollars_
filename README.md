The goal is to train a multi-layer feed-forward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). The task is to
build a neural network model that can accurately classify the digits in the test set.
